# Milk-Weights-Data-Storage

This application will have a GUI that will be able to interact with the user. There are specific milk weights and formatting in MilkWeights.csv so please use a file with a similar format otherwise the application will reject the file. Make sure to download all the txt files so the output from the program will go directly there and you can view the reports as a text file if you so want to. 

Make sure to download all the files in the repository. The preferences are set for the settings. There is a manifest and an executable.jar file if you so need.
